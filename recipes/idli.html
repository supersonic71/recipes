    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p>Idli or idly are a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, <br>
        popular as breakfast foods in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made <br>
        by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. <br>
        The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily <br>
        metabolised by the body.</p>
         
    <p>Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. <br>
        Regional variants include sanna of Konkan.
