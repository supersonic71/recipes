    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p>A dosa is a thin batter-based dish (usually crispy) originating from South India, <br>
        made from a fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. <br>
        Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, <br>
        smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in <br> 
        South Indian cuisine, but now have been popular all over the Indian subcontinent. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and sambar in recent times. <br>
        Chutney is a fine paste made up of groundnut, coconut and lentil. <br>
